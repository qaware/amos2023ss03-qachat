# T5 with Langchain
**Author:** Abdelkader Alkadour, Hafidz Arifin  
**Date:** May 2023

## Requirements
* Get Hugging Face Access Token (You need a Hugging Face account) [link](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
* Import necessary python package:
    * [langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/)
    * [huggingface_hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/installation)

## Steps
* replace access token in the code
* (optional) replace the question with yours
* run the code

### Comments
* We were able to run the LLM prototype but when we tried another time there was a problem on huggingface side. On their website this is written:
  ⚠️ This model could not be loaded by the inference API. ⚠️ Model google/flan-t5-xl does not exist
